## About me
Hello! I am 37 years old, I have been studying programming for almost a year (starting from august 2021) since I entered `Alem School` - learning golang, javascript, rust.
I started my first steps in programming while working in logistics, when I decided to write my own small program that would facilitate my daily routine and submit reports at the end of each week. During the Covid period, changing professions has become much more relevant. Which is what I used.

In addition to studying at school, I try to read specialized books, participate in parallel courses, hackathons, solve problems on `hackerrank` or `leetcode`, improve my english and etc.

## Skills
- Golang (intermediate)
- Javascript (basic)
- HTML (basic)
- CSS (basic)
- Sqlite, MSSql, MySql
- Linux

## Code example (Codewars)
```js
// my first code on codewars
// Examples: spinWords("Hey fellow warriors") => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw"

function spinWords(string){
    return string.split(' ').map(el => {
        return el.length > 4 ? el.split('').reverse().join('') : el;
    }).join(' ');
}
```
